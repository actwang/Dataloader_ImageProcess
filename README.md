# Dataloader_ImageProcess
dataloader for image processing that read images, random resize, crop and flip, and generate labels for images
Tasks:
1. Read images in grayscale from a provided image path containing images at 600dpi
2. Randomly resize an image to one of the following resolutions: 600dpi, 500dpi,
   400dpi, and then resize it back to its original size (for 600dpi, use the original
   image directly).
   
3. Randomly crop the resulting image to size of 256 Ã— 256.
4. Randomly flip the image horizontally or vertically
5. Generate the label for the images, which is the one-hot encoding of their resolution
   class index. Here we can use indices [0, 1, 2] to represent [600dpi, 500dpi, 400dpi],
   respectively.
6. Return a pair of tensors, (imgs, labels), when dataloader.get batch() is called

Visualize results after these operations.
